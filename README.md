Remix PWA is a lightweight, standalone npm package that adds full Progressive Web App support to Remix ðŸ’¿.

## Features

- Automatic caching for `build` files and static files.
- Implements a network-first strategy for loader calls (i.e Gets a fresh request each time when online, and proceeds to an older fallback when offline)
- Auto-caching loader calls to allow offline client-side transitioning between pages
- Safely handles uncached loader calls without affecting other sections of the site (i.e Throws user to nearest Error boundary)

## Installation

```sh
npm install remix-pwa
```

During installation, you would be required to choose the current language you are using with your Remix project, JavaScript or TypeScript.

> This package requires `esbuild` to be installed.
## Setting up your PWA

> v0.3.0 update: *`remix-pwa` automatically updates scripts now, so you don't need to do any editing to the `package.json` file.*

After installing `remix-pwa`, add the `manifest` file in order to get installability feature of PWA as well as app characteristics and other features, simply add the following block of code to the head in your `root` file above the `<Links />` tag:

```
